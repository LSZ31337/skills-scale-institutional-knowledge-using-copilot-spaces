# OctoAcme — Retrospective & Continuous Improvement

## Purpose
Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements.

## When
After each sprint, release, or important milestone. Also after incidents.

## Structure
- What went well
- What could be improved
- Action items (owner, due date)
- Follow-up on previous action items

## Running a Retrospective
- Timebox: 45–75 minutes depending on team size
- Use an anonymous idea board if needed to encourage candor
- **Invite Release Manager, QA Lead, Support Engineer, and UX Designer to share process gaps, cross-team handoff issues, and pain points.**
- Prioritize 2–3 top action items to avoid overload

## Tracking Improvements
- Add action items to the project backlog or issues with clear owners and timelines
- **Assign owners from all relevant roles—not just PM/PdM/Dev—to ensure accountability and broad process coverage.**
- Review outstanding actions in the weekly PM sync
